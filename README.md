# loglm_hybridmodel
Log-transformed linear models for hybrid source apportionment using observation data and CMAQ source contributions.

In this repository, an R script containing major functions used to construct this model is provided. Compared to the last edition, functions are made faster and more flexible for any dataset.

Feel free to discuss with me for detailed information.
